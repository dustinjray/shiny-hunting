# shiny_chances

So I made this tool for shiny hunting Dynamax Adventures in Pokemon Sword and Shield. There are quite a few pokemon you can get in the Dynamax Adventures mode, but all of them are not present. This app is to help you keep track of which shiny Pokemon you've already found, and which ones are left to find, so you don't waste your time looking for something that isn't there.

For reference, in case you didn't know, the shiny odds in Dynamax adventures are 1/300 without the Shiny Charm and 1/100 with the Shiny Charm. Since you can capture 4 Pokemon per run with a 100% success rate, that means that with the shiny charm, you have an approximately 4% chance to find a Shiny right out of the gate. Those odds sound dismal, but they're actually really good.
